            <h1>Research Works & <br><span>Development</span> <br>Models</h1>
            <p class="par">During the past two decades, PhD graduate numbers have increased dramatically with graduates<br> viewed by governments as a means to advance the knowledge economy and international<br> competitiveness. Concurrently, universities have also invested in policies to monitor satisfaction, <br>retention, and timely completion—and researchers have expanded the study of PhD experience. <br>We, as such researchers, have increasingly received invitations from university decision-makers<br> to present research evidence which might guide their doctoral programs. Their interest provoked<br> us to do a qualitative systematized review of research on doctoral experience—seeking evidence<br> of practices that influenced retention, satisfaction, and completion. The result contributes a synthesis of the critical research evidence that could be used to inform doctoral education policy. We also demonstrate the possibilities of such evidence by suggesting some potential recommendations, while recognizing that there is no direct relationship between research results and their transformation into particular institutional contexts in ways that enhance doctoral experience. We hope our initiative will be taken up and extended by other researchers, particularly the research gaps we note, so we can collectively support the use of research evidence to influence both doctoral policies and practices—with the goal to better prepare PhD researchers for their futures and better support their supervisors.</p>
